Tespeed (terminal speedtest) - Copyright 2012 Janis Jansons (janis.jansons@janhouse.lv)


    This is a new Tespeed version written in Python (for the purpose of learning it).

    The old one was written in PHP years ago and wasn't really made for general
    public (was fine tuned and possibly working only on my server).

    Even though the old version didn't work on most boxes, it somehow got
    almost 17 000 downloads on Sourceforge. I guess some people could use this
    (those who hate Flash, JavaScript, has GUI-less servers, etc.) so I'll
    try to make this one a bit better working in time.

    Let's call this version 1.0-alpha


    Of course, this script could not work like this without the best speed 
    testing site out there - http://www.speedtest.net/
    Support them in any way you can (going to their website and clicking on
    ads could probably make them a bit happier). :)


Installing:

    This script requires lxml Python2 module
    install python-lxml (Debian) or python2-lxml (Archlinux)


What the script does:

 *  Loads config from speedtest.net (http://speedtest.net/speedtest-config.php).

 *  Gets server list (http://speedtest.net/speedtest-servers.php).

 *  Picks 5 closests servers using the coordinates provides by speedtest.net 
    config and serverlist.

 *  Checks latency for those servers and picks one with the lowest.

 *  Does download speed test and returns results.

 *  Does upload speed test and returns results.


TODO:

 *  Add more error checking.
 *  Make it less messy.
 *  Send found results to speedtest.net API (needs some hash?) and get the link
    to the generated image.
 *  Store the measurement data and draw graphs.
 *  Measure the speed for the whole network interface (similar like it was in the
    old version of Tespeed).
